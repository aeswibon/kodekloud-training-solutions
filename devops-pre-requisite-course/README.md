### Networking Basics

To add the IP address for the different servers, run the follwing command in each app node:

For app01: `sudo ip addr add 172.16.238.15/24 dev eth0` \
For app02: `sudo ip addr add 172.16.238.16/24 dev eth0` \
For app03: `sudo ip addr add 172.16.239.15/24 dev eth0` \
For app04: `sudo ip addr add 172.16.239.16/24 dev eth0`

To get access to app node, use `ssh {name}` command. Like for app01, command would be `ssh app01`

To enable access to `app03` and `app04`, we need to add the network range to our host. \
This can be done by the following command: `sudo ip addr add 172.16.239.10/24 dev eth0`

To add the router so that the app node can ping each other, run the following in each app node:

For app01: `sudo ip route add 172.16.239.0/24 via 172.16.238.10` \
For app02: `sudo ip route add 172.16.239.0/24 via 172.16.238.10` \
For app03: `sudo ip route add 172.16.238.0/24 via 172.16.239.10` \
For app04: `sudo ip route add 172.16.238.0/24 via 172.16.239.10`
